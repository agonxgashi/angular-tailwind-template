# Angular Tailwindcss template

## What's this?
This is a clean and ready-to-go Angular project with tailwindcss libraries included

- Uses Angular v11
- Uses [ngneat/tailwind](https://github.com/ngneat/tailwind) to add tailwindcss on top of that angular project
    - `@tailwindcss/forms` and `@tailwindcss/typography` plugins are installed


## How to run?

Same as you'd run any other Angular application:
- Clone this repository on your local environment
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `ng serve` to start the application
- Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser

## Now what?
- There is an `app.component.html` file. You can use that as a playground for trying tailwind or as a starting point for your next ü¶Ñ startup.
- If this works for you and you find this template useful, consider starting or sharing this repo with others üôà
